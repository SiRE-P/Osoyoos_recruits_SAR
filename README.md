### Scripts to 
1. Estimate total annual Osoyoos Lake Sockeye returns to the mouth of the Columbia River and combine with adult age composition (c/o Jeff Fryer (Fisheries Scientist at CRITFC) to generate annual recruitment by smolt outmigration year. Combine the latter with juvenile production (based on in-lake pre-smolt abundance index) for annual index of smolt-to-adult survival (Osoyoos Sox Recruit & Survival.Rmd).
2. A by-product of this process is the derivation of annual returns estimates of Skaha Lake Sockeye, a viable sub-stock in the Okanagan River system, translocated from the Osoyoos Lake population.
